    "## 👋 Introduction\n",
    "The following Jupyter notebook briefly presents MASSIVEChem, a pip-installable python package. This package is developped around mass spectrometry, a tool commonly used in analytical chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceutical sciences and more. Fundamentally, this package simulates and plots the mass spectrum of a given molecule, with a chosen resolution and with a chosen precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "This package was created as a collaborative project for the EPFL course Practical programming in chemistry [![GitHub3](https://img.shields.io/badge/EPFL-CH200-red.svg)](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/en/bachelor/chemistry-and-chemical-engineering/coursebook/practical-programming-in-chemistry-CH-200)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going through the code and the use of the package, let's briefly discuss the ideas that led to the building this package\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the plan for this project was to write a code that would predict the NMR spectrum of an input molecule. 3 weeks were spent trying to figure out a way to analyze molecules, to find functional groups, and to predict the shift of the hydrogens in a molecule. As we began tring to write the code, it became apparent to us that this project was beyond the scope of our abilities as it would most likely require the use of machine learning, a concept that none of us were familiar with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Still wanting to create a package that would display some type of visual information from a molecule, our minds collectively turned towards mass spectrometry. Being familiar with the theoretical concepts behind this analytical method, having followed a course on mass spectrometry in first year and having briefly revisited the topic in our second-year electromagnetics course, we were more confident in our abilities regarding this idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of mass spectrometry consists of ionizing a molecule and passing this molecule in a strong magnetic field. Thanks to the Lorentz force, the molecule is deviated as a function of its mass which allows to separate the different isotopes present in a sample. By  putting a detector at the end, it is possible to determine which molecule was put in the mass spectrometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding wise, simulating the mass spectrum was done by using list comprehension and combinatorics. This involves a systematic breakdown of the process into discrete steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Molecule Definition: First the molecule to be analysed needs to be defined, specifying its constituant atoms and their relative abundances. Any molecule can be represented as a data structure (a list) containing its atoms and their relative abundances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fragmentation Simulation: Then, the fragmentation process needs to be simulated. This step involves generating all possible combinations of masses for each atom using the algorithm of probability trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Mass Calculation: The Mass of each fragment is calculated by summing the masses of the constituant atoms. This step ensures that each fragment is assigned an accurate mass value based on its atomic composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combination of Fragments: At the end of the mass calculation process, all fragments are combined into a single list and the fragments with identical masses are combined. This aggregated list represents the collective set of fragments resulting from the analysed molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mass Spectrum Simulation: This step involves calculating the abundance of each possible molecule considering the relative abundances of each of the atoms within. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualization: The mass spectrum can then be plotted using a plotting package. In our case, bokeh was chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the spectrum was simulated, we thought of different features to add to the spectrum to facilitate its comprehensiveness and its readibility. First we added an image of the molecule using inbuilt RDkit functions. Then we developped a function to recognise the functional groups present in the molecule, as well as a function to show them. To make the spectrum more interactive, we added a second plot which allows to see where the user is zooming in on the principal graph. Finally, it was decided to add a function to show an interactive 3D graph of the molecule using xyz2graph package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 👨🏼‍🔬 Difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we had written the code that would do the actual computation of the different combinations of isotopes that can compose the molecule (with their relative probabilities of existing), it became noticeable that the time complexity of the algorithm was subpar (being of roughly $2^n$ with n being the number of atoms in the molecule; the code would take ~30s to run for pentane). To remedy this fact, a part of code was implemented that would disregard any molecule with a probability of under $10^{-6}$ of existing (this reduced the time complexity form $2^n$ to roughly n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difficulty encountered was importing data. The initial project included a data folder for importing the abundances of the various isotopes. Unfortunately, when the package was exported via PyPi, the files inside the aforementioned folder were not included. Once installed, the package could not read the data files required for the package to function correctly.\n",
    "Despite various attempts to include these data files in the package, we had to come up with another solution that did not use this folder. As the initial code used the path to this folder to read the isotope abundances, we had to modify the code written so far to incorporate the data directly without using an external file. This can be seen at the beginning of the spectrum function. \n",
    "In the end, the problem was solved, although this required some 70 extra lines of code, whereas had the data folder been properly imported, a few would have sufficed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding a good tool to create the mass spectrum graph was also a challenge. Various tools such as matplotlib or plotly can be used to create high quality graphs, but only certain of them met the three criteria we wanted: precision, interactivity and aesthetics. So we had to explore tools that allowed us to do this, and Bokeh was chosen. It allowed us to generate graphs as we wanted them and with excellent quality. None of us had used it before, so we had to learn how to use it correctly and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difficulty arose directly from the SMILES, which we used to detect the different functional groups present in the molecule. We had to create a code that differentiated between the various groups. Thus was acheived using SMARTS, which enabled us to specify the differences and in particular the bonds of each atom.\n",
    "Take an ester, for example. The system detects a carboxylic acid when it's not one so we had to specify this using the following SMARTS \"CC(=O)[Oh0]\". Which specifies that the oxygen does not have a bond with a hydrogen.\n",
    "All the different smarts used are present in the function \"functional_group_display\" in the scripts folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "##  ⚙️ Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete package does, however, have a few limitations. \n",
    "Firstly, pure elements and other molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides do not have their own SMILES. It is therefore impossible to visualise their mass spectra using this package. \n",
    "However, we believe that it would be possible to implement these molecules without SMILES using other encoding methods. For example, by using PubChemPy, we could have implemented a function that translates IUPAC names into SMILEs representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is obviously time. The more complex the molecule, the more atoms it contains, the longer it will take to run the programme, so a (slightly) imprecise spectrum is calculated, by disregarding arrangements with a probability below a certain level, as previously explained. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example* : \n",
    "spectrum(mol_smi, imprecision_True_False, apparatus_resolution)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) If imprecision_True_False = True, we have a complexity of $n$\n",
    "2) If imprecision_True_False = False, we have a complexity of $2^{n}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where n = number of atoms in the molecule"
